<h1>Ethertoff: experiments in real-time collaboration on writing and design</h1>

<p>The tools to design publications reflect the divisions of labour used in the world of graphic design. When one starts to use tools for that originate in another field as design tools, they bring a long new ideas of how the work process is organised. This is the case when using web technologies like HTML and CSS for designing publications. One important change is that the tools enable all kinds of new ways to work together.</p>

<p>Traditional design software offer a solitary experience. It takes a very organised design studio the organise a collaboration in inDesign. The first hurdle: collaborators must all own the same version of the program. Then, there is the problem that with inDesign a publication is contained in one big binary file. If two people change that same file in different locations, it is nigh impossible to consolidate these changes.</p>

<p>A publication created with HTML is contained in a series of text files. These text files are ‘plain text’: the most simple way a computer can store data, and readable by the most basic of text editing programs. &nbsp;Computer programmers have long had a (sometimes unhealthy) love affair with plain text, as it is the format in which they store their codes.&nbsp;There is a huge amount of tools developed to deal with plain text, and an especially interesting are these that enable collaboration.&nbsp;This means that designing publications in HTML and CSS allows designers to use a whole new set of tools.</p>

<p>One of these technologies that suddenly makes a lot of sense to use is Git. A very sophisticated program that is meant to track revisions of files, and allow people to work on their own version of the files after which these new versions can be merged back together in various ways. The advantage is that users can work on their own devices in their own private space, and synch the changes after.</p>

<p>There is an other form of collaboration that is theoretically possible in Graphic design programs, but seldomly implemented: Real-time collaboration. Real-time collaboration is a method of working together where multiple people are working on the same document at the same time. It is different from most other forms of collaboration in the sense that users can see each others updates directly.&nbsp;Google Docs is the most well known of such software, but an early and adorable incarnation of the paradigm is Etherpad. Like tellyou describes in ‘I like tight pants and Etherpad Or The Textarea Is A Lonely Place’, it is an addictive model that would feel in place in many web applications.</p>

<h5>A brief history of aether</h5>

<p>Christiaan Huygens, prior to Newton, had hypothesized that light was a wave propagating through an aether.</p>

<p>In the late 19th century, luminiferous aether, æther or ether, meaning light-bearing aether, was the postulated medium for the propagation of light.</p>

<p>In Douglas Adam's 1979 novel the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, there exists an internet-like network called Sub-Etha.</p>

<p>SubEthaEdit (2003) is a texteditor for Mac OS that permits real-time collaboration. The neame is a direct reference to SubEtha. The collaboration takes place over the local network.</p>

<p>The interface is very much inspired by SubEthaEdit, including the colour-coding of different author’s contributions and the chat screen. The applications main innovation is the shift from the desktop to the web applicatin. This is an impressive feat technically as the internet is</p>

<p>Etherpad is bought by Google. It serves as the basis for Google Wave (2009). Google Wave tries to combine all the different paradigms of using text online into one application: wiki, e-mail, discussion board, chat room. Its name still references the aether.</p>

<p>Google wave is not a success: the application knowing how to do everything at once, it does not show a convincing usecase. Etherpad’s innovations are re-used on newer Google products like Google Docs.</p>

<h2>Relearn</h2>

<p class="p1">The first version of Ethertoff was developed to create this publication. The concept is that the platform should provide for a fluid path from note-taking, to editing, to styling, to creating a printed publication. The OSP Relearn Summer School was based on pedogocial experimentation: shifting roles and models of knowledge exchange. Ethertoff reflects this. Whereas the traditional publishing model is ordered sequentially, in Ethertoff all options are available all at once.</p>

<p class="p1">Such a flexible approach was bound to create conflict. One is that it becomes impossible, for better or for worse, to finish the publication, as authors and editors always feel like they can still change their texts at any moment. The potential for change allows editors to leave text in a state that they would not otherwise leave it in. This effect is heightened by the collaborative aspect, as editors feel like another editor might finish their job later.</p>

<p class="p1">On the web, one is used to seeing text with no or minimal copy-editing. Also, one is used to web platforms like Wikipedia where a&nbsp; ‘final’ version of a text does not exist. Once the publication shifts to the printed form, this becomes very different. Print has the connotation of finality. The lineair nature of the book also suggests the possibility of a tension arc, whereas in a hyperlinked space all pages are created equal, and usaually no fixed path is set between them. Reading the rough, multi-voiced, unfinished text typeset as a traditional book clashes with all the associations we have with the printed page.</p>

<p class="p1">To resolve this conflict we tried to let the typesetting of the text reflect its origins. Etherpad uses background colours to delimit different authors. By default this information gets thrown away on export. We kept it, and transformed it to a graphical form better fit for the laser printer. One can see which author contributed which part of speech, understanding the process by which the text has come about.</p>

<p class="p1">This version was developed by Eric Schrijver, with Stéphanie Vilayphiou. Design by Piere Huyghebaert, Ludivine Loiseau, Samuel Rivers Moore, Eric Schrijver, Stéphanie Vilayphiou. At the Hackathon ‘Free Libararies for Every Soul’, Ludivine Loiseau and Eric Schrijver implemented the feature to edit CSS directly as a pad.</p>

<h2>f-u-t-u-r-e.org</h2>

<p class="p1">BAT is a French publisher producing among others the magazine . BAT decided that an online publishing platform would be a nice addition&nbsp; In contrast with the texts on Relearn BAT’s texts are created following a rigorous editing process. Working with Etherpads eliminates much of the drudgery of sending Word files from author to editor and back again. Since launching f-u-t-u-re.org, Bat has been publishing a large series of texts online, and published two printed versions of longer articles, created with the tool.</p>

<p class="p1">Given the instability of Etherpad’s rich text features, this versions offers two additional ways of styling text: with markdown, or by using pure HTML codes. The style to use is determined by the pad’s extension. This version also allows the generation of indexes from Metadata. It is integrated with the HTML2print project to give the editors more control over the print output. The platform was commissioned by BAT éditions and financially supported by the CNAP. In addition, the Montpellier art centre La Panacée enabled a residency for OSP to collaborate more closely with BAT. Design by BAT. Developed by Alexandre Leray, Eric Schrijver and Stéphanie Vilayphiou.</p>

<h2>VJ14</h2>

<p class="p1">The Media Lab Constant VZW was involved in the Relearn Summer School and had witnessed the process of its publication. For their own festival VJ14 they employed a somewhat different tactic: an initial group of notetakers worked during the festival, and several months later a group of editors worked to create the publication.</p>

<p class="p1">The main additions for the platform were ameliorating the indexes function and the possibity to create a static</p>

<h2>Ethertoff.js</h2>

<p class="p1">Until now, the various versions of Ethertoff have been complicated to install. This is because they combined two different technology stacks: one Etherpad installation running on Node.js, and one wiki software built upon the Django framework, running on the Python programming language. Both parts need their own databases, and the synchronisation is sometimes brittle.</p>

<p class="p1">As part of the Starter Grant from the Creative Industries Fund, I rewrote the basis of ethertoff to work with the Node.js framework Derby.js. This framework comes with its own implementation of Operational Transformations, the underlying technology in Etherpad that manages to synchronise the changes across collaborators.</p>

<p class="p1">The new version has a tighter coupling to the file-system, allowing to initialise its database from a folder of files. It uses the CodeMirror editor to provide such amenities as syntax highlighting.</p>

<p class="p1">This version of Ethertoff was used by a Christophe Clarijs, Thomas Laar, Lies Mertens, Wilco Monen, Eline van der Ploeg, Janine Terlouw to create a typographic interpretation of the evening ‘Beeldmakers’ at the Brakke Grond, Amsterdam. The concept: if form and content are both important in Design, it makes sense if the documentation can use both dimensions. By creating live the stylesheet and the text of the documentation. Ethertoff.js prooved to have its share of peculiarities. A video of the process is included below:</p>

<p class="p1">To make Ethertoff perform better I have been in touch with the Open Source community surrounding Derby.js and Lever, the company in which the framework originated. I’ve visited the Lever offices in San Francisco and am currently planning the best way of continuing the development of Ethertoff.js.</p>
