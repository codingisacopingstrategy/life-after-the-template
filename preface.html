<h1>Is there life after the the template?</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most persistent impulse of twentieth-century art and design was to physically integrate form and content. The Dada and Futurist poets, for example, used typography to create texts whose content was inextricable from the concrete layout of specific letterforms on a page. In the twenty-first century, form and content are being pulled back apart. Style sheets, for example, compel designers to think globally and systematically instead of focusing on the fixed construction of a particular surface. This way of thinking allows content to be reformatted for different devices or users, and it also prepares for the afterlife of data as electronic storage media begin their own cycles of decay and obsolescence.</p>

<p>Current database-driven web architectures separate content (data) from form (templates, stylesheets). By changing one file (the template) the design for all pages changes: this automatisation is highly efficient. The content is separated as much from the template as possible, residing in a ‘database’—prepared to be repurposed as easily as possible. What does this mean for the role of a graphic designer, whose intelligence traditionally resides in creating relations between form and content?</p>

<p>Is there a life after the template—are there ways in which designers can adapt the design of individual articles and pages, and still retain the possibility of indexing and syndication that are so important with database-driven websites?</p>

<p>This publication is a first step in answering these questions. Made possible by a grant from the &nbsp;Creative Industries Fund NL, it presents a number of case studies that can help imagine digital publishing tools and infra-structures that allow designers the leeway to make interesting relations between form and content.</p>
