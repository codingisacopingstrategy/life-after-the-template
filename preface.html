<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most persistent impulse of twentieth-century art and design was to physically integrate form and content. The Dada and Futurist poets, for example, used typography to create texts whose content was inextricable from the concrete layout of specific letterforms on a page. In the twenty-first century, form and content are being pulled back apart. Style sheets, for example, compel designers to think globally and systematically instead of focusing on the fixed construction of a particular surface. This way of thinking allows content to be reformatted for different devices or users, and it also prepares for the afterlife of data as electronic storage media begin their own cycles of decay and obsolescence.</p>

<p>Current database-driven web architectures separate content (text, data) from form (templates, stylesheets). By changing one file (the template) the design for all pages changes: this automatisation is highly efficient. The content is separated as much from the template as possible, residing in a ‘database’—prepared to be repurposed as easily as possible. What does this mean for the role of a graphic designer, whose intelligence traditionally resides in creating relations between form and content?</p>

<p>Is there a life after the template—are there ways in which designers can adapt the design of individual articles and pages, and still retain the possibility of indexing and syndication that are so important with database-driven websites?</p>

<p>This publication is a first step in answering these questions. Made possible by a grant from the Creative Industries Fund NL, it presents a number of case studies that can help imagine digital publishing tools and infra-structures that allow designers the leeway to make interesting relations between form and content.</p>

<h1>The liaison between form and content</h1>

<p>*When we think of the relations between form and content made in design, there are prototypical examples make this relation obvious. In Apollinaire’s <em>Calligrammes</em> the lay-out resembles the subject (the rain, the water fountain, the eiffel tower.)</p>

Craven, 1921). It is not known if Shaw had the chance to examine the proofs for any of these editions.</figcaption>

<p>For some author/designers the link is more subtle. In his essay ‘On Modern Typography’ Bernard Shaw admits: “When a proof has been sent me with two or three lines so widely spaced as to make a grey band across the page, I have often rewritten the passage so as to fill up the lines better (…)”. He attributes the same practice to William Morris. Dave Eggers supposedly writes his books in Quark Xpress directly.</p>

<p>Even if the text is not edited in function of the design, the design adds a layers of intelligence to the publication that are easily lost in translation. Making line-breaks, choosing typefaces, creating hierarchy through typography—all the usual labour of the designer influences the reading experience. The newspaper redesigned their Content Management System, titles and subtitles got merged. The subtitles that were often much more whimsical than the titles themselves suddenly got an importance in the design that made for an awkward reading experience.</p>

<p>The design associated with a text also guides the expectations of the reader. When the American association for graphic designers, AIGA, created their series of Design Theory Readers, ‘Looking closer’, they took their cues from the Scientific Publishing when it came to the design. All articles have the same sober, conservative typography. The unified design makes the reader forget the writing contained is from a variety of publications: fashion magazines like I.D. magazine and 032c, trade magazines like PRINT, but also magazines in which graphic design criticism has a more central place, like Emigre. The end result is that texts that were written to communicate to a mainstream magazine audience feel summary and superficial in the scientific lay-out. If some visual cues from the original publication contexts would have survived, it would be easier to appreciate these texts for what they are.</p>

<h1>With time it falls apart: design online</h1>

<p>When publishing an article on an online publication, the means to link form and content are similar to that of traditional publications. Even if the tools are different, designers still use typography to structure content, and the overall design of the site will construe a context that informs the reading experience. The big difference is that, in most cases, the design will morph and adapt over time, cutting the link with the text.</p>

<p>This dynamic hit home for me through a remark by JODI’s Dirk Paesmans. In the early days of the World Wide Web, the website of Wired was done according to the latest trends in web design. Much like the paper magazine Wired had a design that evolved from issue to issue. But it would not be just the only the latest articles that would show the new design. Everything would change. After a particularly successful re-design of the site, Dirk was sad to see everything change over again in the next revolution.</p>

<p>Paper magazines have the luxury of being able to evolve from issue to issue, while the older issues still encode a specific cultural moment, as testified by the text, the design, even the advertisements. A website drags its mutating past along, continuously redesigning it all.</p>

<p>That the form of a web page is less fixed than that of a printed page might seem obvious. Up to a certain degree web pages are inherently flexible: HTML, a markup language, was designed to give considerable freedom to the interpreting device when it comes to the visual representation. Yet some parts of the way we deal with design online aren’t as much inherent in HTML, they have more to do with the web architectures chosen. These architectures often have an underlying belief in the separation between form and content.</p>

<p>The tendency to separate form and content has its roots in the web’s foundation as a medium for scientists. Science, and by extension scientific publishing, is based on standardising form. Magazines will provide templates to follow for authors.</p>

<p>Even then, the early web technologies did not enforce much separation between form and content. Authors could freely add formatting instructions everywhere in the text. Separation between form (or rather, style) and content only became feasible with the introduction of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that allow to store style information apart from the content. For any of the pre-defined tags that HTML offers (heading, paragraph, list item) the style sheet describes how it should be displayed.</p>

<p>One style-sheet can be used for an entire web-site, and changing the style-sheet once can change the look of all pages. A rag tag coalition of browser vendors, standards bodies and web designer/developers have managed to make adoption of CSS nearly ubiquitous.</p>

<p>A second technological development that has helped to separate form from content online is the advent of Content Management Systems. First only available to large organisation, powerful systems like WordPress and Joomla have become available for everybody. In these systems, a general design is encoded into a template, and the contents for individual pages are stored in a database that is easily editable by the user. For clients this saves time and money. The downside is that a CMS requires shoehorning every page into templates: early HTML pages offered much more freedom in this respect, as potentially every page could be modified and changed to the designer’s whims.</p>

<p>As long as websites use centralised CSS files and templates that get modified for each redesign, the links between form and content will keep getting cut online. The goal of this publication is to start imagining alternatives for these web architectures.</p>

<h1>Life after the template</h1>

<p>In this publication we will find two case studies of workflows that make more intimate links between form and content. The study for the Fotomuseum Winterthur is a proposition. Developed with Loraine Furter and the Hybrid Publishing Consortium, it imagines digital publishing strategies that connect with the print production process, and share the encoding of design between print and screen. The second case study, a description of the workflow for creating digital theses at the KABK, has been actually put into practice. Inspired by the process by which amateurs made homepages in the 1990ies, it has allowed graphic design students to create digital publications without the constraint of a template.</p>

<p>The digital tool Ethertoff is introduced, which is one of the first collaborative editing system to also allow the collaborative editing of the style of a publication. An interview with Jort de Vries, designer from the Dutch start-up Blendle, introduces the way in which Blendle translates the typographic diversity of print to the screen.</p>

<p>Finally, as an appendix, the article ‘Tonight we’re going to publish like it’s 1999’ is a shorter text that reiterates many of the themes in the publication in an accessible format.</p>

<p>Of course, I would welcome your comments.</p>
