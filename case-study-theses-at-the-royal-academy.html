<p>The Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague, The Netherlands runs a well-known Graphic Design Bachelor program. In recent years head teachers Roosje Klap and Niels Schrader have reinvigorated the program with a focus on social responsibility and the appropriation of digital technologies. Each year in the four-year program features as a subject both Coding and Interaction Design.</p>

<p>The Bachelor thesis has been an important part of the curriculum for many years. It allows the student to research into a specific area of interest and will provide a theoretical foundation for their final exam project. The theses have traditionally had a final output form of a printed publication: they are archived in the school libraries. With the curriculum placing more importance in digital design, the nature of the thesis is open to be re-imagined.</p>

<p>The form of the thesis in art education is distinct from the papers written at Universities, especially seen in relation to the role of the template.&nbsp;The challenge has been to come up with a workflow for creating digital theses that gave the students the needed flexibility to express their ideas both in writing and design.</p>

<section data-type="sect1">
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>

<p>Starting in the academic year 2014/2015 we ask students to create their thesis for the screen. More specifically, we presented the students not with a screen-only model, but a screen-centric model. The students are free to create a print version of their thesis, but are encouraged to take the version conceived for the screen as the departure point.</p>

<p>Scientific publications often choose a pre-formatted form. Magazines will provide templates to follow for authors, that in most cases use Microsoft Word or the LaTex authoring system.&nbsp;The first texts to be shared online were academic papers, and the separation of form and content that is habitual in academic publishing has permeated every aspect of the online publishing eco-system.&nbsp;In contrast, the&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.3em;">students in The Hague are are expected to engage in the design of their thesis. Form and content are decidedly mixed.</span>&nbsp;So it was clear that the last thing we wanted to do is to give the students a template.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were additional requirements. With a group of 50 students, we needed to be able to follow the process of all students, be able to give feedback. Also, we are legally required to archive all theses. Finally, we want to publish the theses online in an accessible and durable way.</p>

<section data-type="sect2">
<h2 id="back-to-the-future">Back to the Future</h2>

<p>The workflow we came up with combines both new and time-tested web publishing technologies.</p>

<p>The students work with what is the raw material of the internet: the web standards HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In most contemporary web systems these files are generated by a dynamic system. We choose to go Back to the Future, and write websites like it’s 1999: we let the students write the actual separate HTML files themselves.</p>

<p>The workflow thus resembles the cultural moment lovingly captured by Ola Lialina in the publication Digital Folklore. The period in the 1990ies when large groups of enthousiasts learned and experimented with the fabric of the web, creating their own websites on such digital platforms as Geocities and in the process shaping the visual codes of the medium.</p>

<p>The theses’ files are exchanged, archived and hosted on a very contemporary platform: code sharing website GitHub. This website, first made popular by programmers, makes accessible to a larger public the advanced collaboration methods developed within the world of Open Source software. Github and the underlying software Git allow collaborators to work on their own version of the code, tracking the history, and then providing the tools to merge the various histories back together again.</p>

<p>Beyond being a place to collaborate, Github also provides us with the tools to archive the theses, and directly publish them online.</p>

<p>Finally, we have experimented with the best ways to create an overview of the theses: using embedded metadata, we are able to automatically generate a home-page for the series of publications.</p>

<h1 id="the-paradox-of-choice">The paradox of choice</h1>

<figure><img alt="Alt Text" class="iimagesjavascript_technology_crazinesspng" src="images/javascript_technology_craziness.png"/>
<figcaption>Even if the technologies of the web are in theory standardised and accessible, the rapid succession of technological fashions makes it hard to get started.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="p1">The landscape of web technology is varied and ever changing. Creating an advanced web project might include choosing a server side programming language (Python, PHP, Node.js) that talks to a database of choice, then creating the visual and interaction design on top of a foundation of front-end ‘frameworks’ and ‘pre-processors’.</p>

<p class="p1">The amount of choices to make is staggering, and the complexities of such systems high. For the project at the KABK we have foregone these technologies, for a more simple, back to basic approach: writing HTML pages.</p>

<p class="p1"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.3em;">The first web-sites were exactly this: ‘hand-crafted HTML’. many small sites were created as a series of HTML pages, with occasional updates (the person designing the site might then charge for each update!). This did not mean coding was necessary: tools like Adobe Dreamweaver provided a visual view and a code view.</span></p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="p1">The democratisation of Content Management Systems like WordPress and Joomla changed the equation. In these systems, a general design is encoded into a template, and the contents for individual pages are stored in a database that is easily editable by the user.&nbsp;For clients this saves time and money. The downside is that a Content Management System requires shoehorning every page into templates: these early HTML pages offered much more freedom in this respect, as potentially every page could be modified and changed to the designer’s whims.</p>

<p class="p1">An ideal system would undoubtedly combine elements of both paradigms: easy customisation and user-friendly content management. But with the design students, we choose to re-appropriate the 1990ies approach.&nbsp;Here are the reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="p1">The contents and design of the thesis are supposed to be intimately related. The web standards HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the language of web design. To be able to directly edit the HTML of the pages instead of generating them through a system, gives the full control needed in this situation.</li>
	<li class="p1">The advantages of Content Management Systems become apparent for larger collections of texts that need to be similarly laid out. The thesis is one text, and not a very long text at that. There is little efficiency to be gained from creating a template.</li>
	<li class="p1">Graphic designers can be expected to know the languages of the web. At least, in the programme at the KABK they are. So even if the editing of text files is not a very accessible method for the larger public, it is perfectly acceptable for the intended audience.</li>
</ul>

<figure><img alt="Working with Github" src="images/kabk_github.png"/>
<figcaption>Collaboration is centralised through the <a href="https://github.com/kabk">KABK Github Organisation</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Github is code hosting site that focuses on facilitating the collaboration between developers. It is built on the Open Source software Git. Each contributor works on their own computer, on their own version of the files. They can then use Git to merge their changes with those of others.</p>

<p>Github also offers the possibility to publish files to the internet. This feature is usually used to publish the documentation for a code project, contained in a special branch. Our ‘hack’ was to only use this branch for the theses. The result was a very nimble workflow: each file-change uploaded to Github was immediately published online.</p>

<p>The setup proved extremely practical for the teachers.&nbsp;Having the work in progress online is very practical for the teacher, for they can simply click through links instead of having to download code. This does mean in-progress texts are publicly accessible. To mitigate this potential problem we have shown students how to make sure their site does not get indexed by search engines.</p>

<h1 id="indexation-syndication">Indexation, Syndication</h1>

<p>The one major advantage of data-base driven Content Management Systems is that it is very easy to generate indexes. The same database from which a single page will be fetched, will just as happily generate a listing of pages, sorted and filtered as the designer demands. Because most CMS’s are dynamic, these indexes will be kept up to date automatically: every time the page is rendered, the indexes will be re-generated.</p>

<p>To create indexes from a collection of HTML files is more involved: since there is no neat database model with fields like ‘title’, ‘author’, ‘publishing date’, one will need a way to discover these metadata from the HTML. Creating indexes by hand is one option, but this is error-prone and tedious.</p>

<p>It becomes even more involved when the indexes themselves are part of the pages, like in the submenu of a publication that show links to other pages. If a collaborator on another page changes its title, or a new page gets added, this submenu should be updated in every page—again, tedious and error-prone.</p>

<p>With the theses at the KABK we decided to tackle the first problem. The students do not create actual links in-between the various theses. But a general index of the theses is desirable.</p>

<figcaption>The meta-data used by Facebook to create previews can be re-purposed to create new forms of navigation and indexing of these pages.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To create the index, we rely on the metadata provided to social networks and search engines. As practical as the database underlying CMS’s is, it has one big problem: it is inaccessible to the outside world. This has been a concern for companies that are built upon indexing and syndicating the web: search engines like Google, and social networks like Facebook and Twitter. These companies want to be able to either index, relate and preview web pages, and they need data for that.</p>

<p>There has been structured metadata for almost as long as HTML exists. As always, there are conflicting standards. RDF/A, microdata and JSON-LD are now competing. We use a set of metadata that is currently recognised by search engines and social networks. The students implement this metadata in their theses. A script ‘scrapes’ all theses, analyses the metadata, and generates the index.</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>

<p>The workflow proposed here makes a lot of sense for documents like the thesis, where one author is in control over all aspects of the publication from the conception to the writing to the interaction design and development. The tools used by the students provided little separation of concerns.</p>

<p>Passing through the text editor requires being code-literate for each task. It also requires thinking about the code while performing tasks such as writing and editing that could be more easy to perform in a WYSIWYG interface, also for those who know how to write code.&nbsp;If the proposed approach where to be more widely implemented, it makes sense to investigate the possibility to allow multiple interfaces to the same source material.&nbsp;Separate interfaces for writing, editing, coding and designing. Luckily, HTML is a rich source format that allows many ways of interacting with it. Historically, the development of editing interfaces for HTML has not been spectacular.&nbsp;<a href="http://i.liketightpants.net/and/hackers-culture-and-the-fear-of-wysiwyg">I like tight pants and hacker culture and the fear of wysiwyg</a> suggests that the reasons for this might be cultural more than technical.</p>

<p>On the website of the end exam exhibition ‘While you were sleeping’ one can consult the presentation of the end exam of the students of the Class of 2015, and find the links to their theses. The end exam exhibition will be held from the 4th to 10th of July.</p>

<h1>Advantages of static sites</h1>

<p>Websites that work without a Content Management System have a number of advantages over more conventional sites.</p>

<section data-type="sect2">
<h2>Speed</h2>

<p class="p1"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.3em;">Before a dynamic web application can serve a page to a user, it will first need to ask information from a database and push this data through a template. HTML can be sent to the user right away. The first web servers like the Apache server made a very simple mapping between urls and folders filled with HTML files, that still holds today. The technology to serve static files has been steadily perfected, and the now popular nginx server does it even faster than Apache.</span></p>
</section>

<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>

<section data-type="sect2">
<h2>Security</h2>

<p class="p2"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.3em;">Since the website does not need to store information in a database, the ‘attack surface’ of a website hosting static files is much smaller. The key here is that the HTML files are generated on a users computer, and uploaded afterwards. A conventional content management system like Wordpress needs to expose a kind of editing functionality through a web interface. Hackers can and will attempt to gain access to this web interface. Because the ways in which the authentication system, the interface, and the database work together are quite complicated, new weak spots are discovered in these systems regularly. Popular projects like Wordpress monitor the security threats actively, and release updated versions as new threats are discovered. But this means anyone using such as system needs to be keeping them up to date.</span></p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2">
<h2>Maintainability &amp; costs</h2>

<p class="p1">Like mentioned in the previous point, dynamic websites need to be kept up to date to stay secure. This requires an amount of work that is non-negligible. A static website, one can essentially forget about: as long as the hosting bills are being paid, it should be able to continue functioning.</p>

<p class="p1">Dynamic websites use more complicated hosting setups. They might even require a system known as a ‘VPS’, a virtual private server that can be fully configured: these cost a substantial amount of time to keep running and are expensive. Static websites can be hosted on more simple infrastructures. The cheapest shared web host will support the necessary technology.&nbsp;</p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect2">
<h2>Archivability</h2>

<p class="p1">A static website is essentially the only guaranteed way of archiving a design. Since dynamic website requires its dependent CMS to be kept up to date, this means keeping up with new versions of the dependent software. The problem is that, as software progresses, it changes, and some functions implemented in the previous versions mutate and disappear. Parts of the website then need to be reimagined, and there is a high chance this has repercussions on the design. Static websites are therefore ideal for sites that need to be archived: their contents needs to remain accessible, but does not need to be updated often.</p>
