<p>Students coded their own design. As part of the curriculum. The decision to use web standards HTML, JavaScript and CSS made development more simple as it removed a layer of choice.</p>

<h1>The paradox of choice</h1>

<p class="p1">The landscape of web technology is varied and ever changing. Creating an advanced web project might include choosing a server side programming language (Python, PHP, Node.js) that talks to a database of choice, and then constructing a user interface on top of a foundation of existing front-end ‘frameworks’ and ‘pre-processors’ . The amount of choices to make is staggering, and the complexities of such systems great. For the project at the KABK we have foregone these technologies, for a more simple, back to basic approach: writing HTML pages.</p>

<p class="p1">The first web-sites were exactly this: ‘hand-crafted HTML’. many small sites were created as a series of HTML pages, with occasional updates (the person designing the site might then charge for each update!). This did not mean coding was necessary: tools like Adobe Dreamweaver provided a visual view and a code view. For clients, obviously, having a content management solution saves time and money. The downside is that a content management system requires shoehorning every page into templates: these early HTML pages offered much more freedom in this respect.</p>

<h1>Advantages of static sites</h1>

<section data-type="sect2">
<h2>Speed</h2>

<p class="p1"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.3em;">Before a dynamic web application can serve a page to a user, it will first need to ask information from a dabase and push this data through a template. HTML can be sent to the user right away. The first web servers like the Apache server made a very simple mapping between urls and folders filled with HTML files, that still holds today. The technology to serve static files has been steadily perfected, and the now popular nGinx server does it even faster than Apache.</span></p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p class="p2"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.3em;">Since the website does not need to store information in a database, the ‘attack surface’ of a website hosting static files is much smaller. The key here is that the HTML files are generated on a users computer, and uploaded afterwards. A conventional content management system (like Wordpress) needs to expose a kind of editing functionality through a web interface. Hackers can and will attempt to gain access to this web interface. Because the ways in which the authentication system, the interface, and the database work together are quite complicated, new weak spots are discovered in these systems regularly. Popular projects like Wordpress monitor the security threats actively, and release updated versions as new threats are discovered. But this means anyone using such as system needs to be &amp; in keeping them up to date.</span></p>

<h2>Maintainability &amp; costs</h2>

<p class="p1">Like mentioned in the previous point, dynamic websites need to be kept up to date to stay secure. This requires an amount of work that is non-negligable. A static website, one can essentially forget about: as long as the hosting bills are being paid, it should be able to continue functioning.</p>

<p class="p1">Dynamic websites use more complicated hosting setups. They might even require a system known as a ‘VPS’, a virtual private server that can be fully configured: these cost a substantial amount of time to keep running and are expensive. Static websites can be hosted on more simple infrastructures. The cheapest shared web host will support the necessary technology.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Archivability</h2>

<p class="p1">A static website is essentially the only guaranteed way of archiving a design. If a dynamic website requires its dependent CMS to be kept up to date. This means going along with new versions of the dependent software. The problem is that, as software progresses, it changes, and some functions implemented in the previous versions mutate and disappear. Parts of the website then need to be reimagined, and there is a high chance this has repercussions on the design. Static websites are therefore ideal for sites that need to be archived: their contents needs to remain accessible, but does not need to be updated often.</p>
