<p>The first edition of Beeldmakers is an evening in Amsterdam for and by contemporary visual makers. Curated by Veerle Devreese, Rolf Coppens and Eric Schrijver the first edition focuses on Screen Typography. Exploring the possibilities offered by the advancing web standards and evolving devices, the evnening features talks by Bas Jacobs and Frederik Berlaen and a typographic </p>

    <dd>After having talked with those who are invested in the nitty gritty of <em>making</em> fonts, no there is a moment to talk with someone who <em>uses</em> them. In fact, Jort just told me they might be the website out there that licenses the most web-fonts… currently serving a stack of over 200 fonts! Today we meet Jort de Vries who is the lead designer for Blendle, a Dutch startup that is translating the typographical diversity of the printed press to the web. We’re very glad to have him with us tonight.</dd>

    <dd>It is a process we start again for each publication. We receive two things from each publication. The PDF’s. These we use to create our view that allows to browse the publications. Then the articles themselves. We receive the XML, that is the same format that the print designers have to integrate into their workflow. We have to take this and create a template that transforms this into the HTML and CSS that make up the design for the screen. So the XML might indicate a heading, a lead, a subheading, and we have to find a way to translate that for the screen. It is a custom process. Every publication has its own structure, and also the files we get from the editor do not always provide all the information we need. Sometimes we ask the publisher to change the structure of their format to make it more clear and easier to process.</dd>
    
    <dt>E.M.</dt>
    <dd>Behind us we see an example of . At your presentation at *, I really liked this image. So basically, you first tried to show its article in a layout specific to Blendle, and then—you try it . The difference is so big</dd>

    <dt>J.d.V.</dt>
    <dd>Yes, that really was key.</dd>

    <dt>R.C.</dt>
    <dd>On a level of choice, how does work—can you get your hands on all typefaces?</dd>

    <dt>J.d.V.</dt>
    <dd>That is true. Not all fonts used in prints we are able to license for the web. So we have to make an approximation, the translation takes place. Of course we also have to a lot of optimisations. There is no way you can load full character sets for 200 fonts at once. Also we deal with multiple font serving services. So there is a lot of improvisation required.</dd>

    <dt>E.M.</dt>
    <dd>Your approach, where each article has its own typographic signature, seems to touch on a larger problem in web architecture. A lot of applications use centralised templates, through which they push all content. Change the template, all contents changes along with it. The kind of line between what is written in a page and the way it looks is cut entirely. In that sense, do you see Blendle’s approach being taken up by other websites?</dd>

    <dt>J.d.V.</dt>
    <dd>Our value proposition is very specific, as we try to translate the typographic diversity from the landscape of periodical press to the screen. I am not sure for other websites this immediately an interesting approach.</dd>

    <dt>E.M.</dt>
    <dd>I remember reading an article on Douglas Rushkoff website, on Timothy Leary. I am reading this in 2012, the design looks very 2010, but the article, I suddenly remember, I have already read in the 1990ies. In translation, in Kijk Magazine. I have a mental image of the layout—very 1990ies. To suddenly see it look 2010 in 2012, it looks so wrong to me. It is such a 1990ies subject as well, the way they talk about the internet. I think I would like more websites to take up this approach</dd>

    <dt>J.d.V.</dt>
    <dd>Lets see about that.</dd>
