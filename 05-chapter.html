<h1>A Hybrid Publishing Strategy for the Catalogues of Fotomuseum Winterthur</h1>

<section data-type="sect1">
<h1>The Museum Catalogue in Post-digital Times</h1>

<p>Within the world of art publishing, the catalogues produced by Fotomuseum Winterthur have acquired a solid reputation. Working with designers such as *,*,* and publishers like *,*,*, and commissions new texts for each catalogue.&nbsp;These books make sure that exhibitions staged at Winterthur reach a larger audience than its rather remote geographical location would otherwise suggest.</p>

<p>Created to high standards of print design and reproduction quality, the catalogues are prime examples of the monograph. The firm commitment to the printed object also come with a down-side. The excellent, yet medium specific objects, are hard to translate to the digital domain. With the public discourse around art taking place in large parts online, there are a myriad of web channels not yet exploited by the Fotomuseum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fotomuseum has asked The Hybrid Publishing Consortium to conduct an investigation in how their publishing tradition can be re-imagined in the context of digital publishing. The Hybrid Publishing asked designers Loraine Furter and Eric Schrijver to be involved in this.</p>

<p>This publishing research case study will focus on one particular publication and exhibition—Manifeste! Eine andere Geschichte der Fotografie (Fotomuseum Winterthur, 13 September to 23 November 2014).</p>

<h2>Exploding the Codex</h2>

<p>Books from the post-Gutenberg era and digital publishing can easily be opposed. In this logic, the codex is demarcated and linear, whereas digital publishing is fragmented, interlinked and embraces the logic of the databases: elements have formal relations but no inherent narrative order.</p>

<p>Upon closer scrutiny, the opposition does not really hold: many elements of the codex return in digital publishing models.&nbsp;The Institute of Network Cultures provides a useful overview of the various digital publishing formats in their publication ‘<a href="http://networkcultures.org/blog/publication/from-print-to-ebooks-a-hybrid-publishing-toolkit-for-the-arts/">From Print to Ebooks: a Hybrid Publishing Toolkit for the Arts</a>’. The following graphic plots the most popular ones:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The y-axis shows types of navigation ranging from standard (meaning, in this case, lineair) to customised. The x-axis shows layout from plain to rich. It is not an accident that the option with the richest layout also has a very lineair navigation. A format like PDF is a page description language: the position of every element is described very carefully. Most other digital publishing formats are based on mark-up languages like HTML: these provide a description of the content that leave a lot more interpretation to the device that finally is going to display it.</p>

<p>The PDF also is the only option where the&nbsp;</p>

<h2>More Arguments for Exploding</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our research shows that a new phase of digital strategy is taking hold in cultural organizations. Whereas the last five years saw them focus predominantly on social media marketing and engagement, we have identified a more recent shift to exploring mature digital channels. Examples of these are–online learning platforms, digital books, open licence content repositories and collaborative research platforms. They demonstrate that the Web has become the platform of choice for critical discourse. The shift we see expresses a horizontal tendency, where participants (audiences) are engaged as co-producers and invited to share and reuse content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, exploded content is more open to re-use and remixing by third parties.</p>

<h1>Exploding Manifeste</h1>

<blockquote>Manifeste! is the first exhibition to explore the historical relationship between photography and the manifesto, collecting together statements from across the history of photography. The publication focuses on practitioners who ‘repeatedly voiced their opinions about the use and perception, as well as the vision and pitfalls of photography’. Manifeste! provides a new perspective on photography and formulates an alternative history of the medium.</blockquote>

<h2>inDesign or Where is the Knowledge Stored</h2>

<figcaption>The workflow for Winterthur publications closely resembles that of many other small and medium sized Art publishers.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The way in which the Winterthur catalogues have been produced is similar to how many smaller art publishers work. The visual design is very important: the relation between form and content is tight. In the case of museum Winterthur, there is no fixed house style—they even work with multiple designers.</p>

<p>The museum, in this sense, works without templates. This does not mean that no optimisation at all is possible: programs like inDesign permit to hook into external Content Management Systems, through the generic exchange technology of XML. This is what larger publishers do—they build custom workflows to enable the sharing of elements between various formats of publications. But because art publishers require both more customisation&nbsp;&nbsp;and have smaller IT budgets, such solutions are hardly ever put in place.</p>

<p>The practical consequence of this workflow, is that all of the knowledge that is produced during the production of the catalogue becomes encoded into one file, the inDesign file. Not only the visual design is stored in this file,&nbsp;also the canonical versions of the texts: since the proofs are created from inDesign, any corrections are often encoded with this program as well.</p>

<p>Because the inDesign is the digital representation of the knowledge represented by the catalogue, the Consortium wanted to find out how much of this knowledge could be extracted from the file, in order to be able to re-use it in other, digital, publishing contexts.</p>

<h2>Le-tex and Transpect</h2>

<p>The Consortium has build up a working relation with the Leipzig based company le-tex. Le-tex specialises in what they call ‘Content Engineering’. Basically, they come up with workflows for publishers for all parts of the process leading up to the publication. This means importing text formats into Content Management Systems, formally verifying them and allowing for proof-reading, version management and conversion strategies between the various digital and analog formats in use.</p>

<p>What is exciting about le-tex, besides their extensive experience, is the fact that they have Open Sourced a large part of their digital solutions. Transpect is an&nbsp;‘open source framework for converting and checking documents’. Our close working relationship and the fact that their tools are Open Source makes us confident in suggesting le-tex’s tools as part of a hybrid publishing workflow.</p>

<p>What is special about Transpect specifically is the way in which it handles lay-out and styling information. Content Management Systems have a tendency to focus on the encoding and exchange of text, leaving styling to ephemeral templates. Transpect takes it upon itself to also translate the various forms in which layout and style can be encoded. Most importantly, it provides facilities for converting inDesign paragraph styles to CSS styles and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>From inDesign to HTML</h2>

<p>The usual workflow with Transpect is to set up a ‘conversion pipeline’ from one format to another. This pipeline is then configured and tweaked to best accomodate the specificities of the input.&nbsp;For our experiment with the Manifeste catalogue, we first opted to convert the inDesign file to HTML. We chose HTML because it is the lingua franca of digital publishing: it is used both on websites and eBooks, and increasingly in mobile applications. It is easy to store and repurpose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The caveat mentioned for art publishers becomes apparent again.&nbsp;While we experimented with converting the inDesign file of the Manifeste catalogue, we found ourselves adapting the pipeline to the specificities of the publication.&nbsp;Letex’s Gerrit Imsieke also came up with a number of changes we could make to the inDesign file itself.</p>

<p>Gerrit also provided a series of guidelines for designers working in inDesign, that make their files easier to process (we added these as an annex). We suggest that Winterthur asks the designers for upcoming catalogues to follow them.</p>

<p>The recommendations will make the process of extracting content easier—but it is probable that every single publication will still require a certain amount of customisation.</p>
